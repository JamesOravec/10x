## 10x Genomics Platform Engineering Technical Coding Prompt

Create a web service that converts a CSV file into an API that exposes JSON.

We've provided a CSV file of Seattle weather in
[`seattle-weather.csv`](./seattle-weather.csv). It contains the following
labels in the header, with the following format:

```
date,precipitation,temp_max,temp_min,wind,weather
...
2012-06-03,0.0,17.2,9.4,2.9,sun
2012-06-04,1.3,12.8,8.9,3.1,rain
...
```

## Your tasks (in no specific order):

1. Read in CSV file, output JSON
2. Create a server that responds to a `GET` request with the output in JSON
3. Set up querying on the data:
    - Limit results to a number `http://my-server.example.com/query?limit=5`
    - By date: `http://my-server.example.com/query?date=2012-06-04`
    - By weather type: `http://my-server.example.com/query?weather=rain`
4. Create multi-query filtering, eg. `http://my-server.example.com/query?weather=rain&limit=5`

## Bonus

1. Bundle the service into a Docker image and run it as a container
2. Query the service API from outside the container

## Bonus 2

1. Write a script to test the service API
2. Bundle the test script into its own Docker image
2. Run the test script image from a separate container and hit the same API
